# hftf
A simple implementation of Huffman encoding to encode any file.

### Compiling
  **Make sure to define HF_EXE**

### Command line
    .\hf.exe zip    <input filepath> <output filename>
  
  \<output filename\>.hftf file will be created. No need for extensions.
      
    .\hf.exe unzip  <.hftf filepath> <output filename.ext>
      
  \<output filename.ext\> file will be created. Add extensions!

*Currently, there isn't any support for storing the initial extensions.*
